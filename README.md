# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
5. Calculate voter turnout for each county.
6. Calulate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
7. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Summary & Overview
Dear election commission,
The script of code I wrote for this analysis can be used, as is for future elections as long as the same format of data is used; Ballot ID, County, and Candidate. The name of the csv file will need to be changed to match the name of the csv results file you are using, and the path to save will need to be updated to match the file location of the csv results file. 

## Challenge Summary & Overview
This module taught me how to use the command line, read, extract, create files using Visual Studio Code- as well as understand the connection between the files. I was able to do more of a deep dive into types of data in Python. I felt that Python was a lot more user friendly than VBA code.
I found this project challenging due to the indentation and amount of code I used to get to the end result. I also had to establish a new SSH key connection in GitHub. The repeptition of the coding and use of GitHub and GitBash are extremely important in this challenge as coding is like learning a foreign language. I was able to successfully add neccessary folders and files, as well as commit many changes to my repository by using GitBash. 
It felt very rewarding by the end of the challenge.

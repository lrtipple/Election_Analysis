## Challenge Summary & Overview
This module taught me how to use the command line, read, extract, create files using Visual Studio Code- as well as understand the connection between the files. I was able to do more of a deep dive into types of data in Python. I felt that Python was a lot more user friendly than VBA code. I found this project challenging due to the indentation and amount of code I used to get to the end result. I also had to establish a new SSH key connection in GitHub. The repeptition of the coding and use of GitHub and GitBash are extremely important in this challenge as coding is like learning a foreign language. I was able to successfully add neccessary folders and files, as well as commit many changes to my repository by using GitBash. It felt very rewarding by the end of the challenge.
